## Basic rules

 - The goal of the game is to get to the finish in the least turns.
 - All cars start at the START tile.
 - Cars cannot collide or interfere with each other in any way.
 - The car has to pass all checkpoints before passing the finish.
 - Adjacent CHECKPOINT tiles count as a single checkpoint.
 - If there is more than one FINISH tile, it does not matter which one the car passes.

## Tile types

ROAD, GRASS, START, CHECKPOINT, FINISH - rideable

WALL - not rideable, 3-turn punishment for crashing into it

WATER - the car will sink and isn't going to be able to continue the race

SAND - the car stops and its velocity is set to {0,0} (this results in only being able to move 1 tile per turn on sand)

ICE - if the car finishes the turn on ice, it cannot be controlled next turn and instead moves in the same trajectory and with the same velocity; if the velocity of the car is 0 (it crashed into a wall on ice), it can be controlled next turn as usual
